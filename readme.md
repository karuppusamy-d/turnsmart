## Dashboard Settings

### Endpoints section:

Endpoints are used to identify the data you want to store on turnsmart.io. You can create as many endpoints as you want. This data can be number or boolean or color.

### Data section:

In the data section, you will see the data of the endpoints you have added. You can modify the data directly from the dashboard. You can use the data to control your smart home devices. The data can be assessed using the turnsmart API from your device.

### Smarthome section:

In the smart home section, you can modify the Google Home integration settings. You can change device type or add/remove device traits.There are many device types available including: light, fan, switch, sensor, etc.

#### Device types

Device types are used by Google Assistant to determine what actions are available to the user. For example, if you define a device as a Light, the user can interact with the device through Google Assistant with Hey Google, turn on my light.

#### Device traits

Device traits are used to define the capabilities of the device. You can add as many traits as you want. For example, if you define a device as a Light, you can add the trait of brightness and color. There are many traits available including: on/off, brightness, color, etc.

For example,

1. You can add a "color" trait to a light device. This will allow you to control the color of the light.
1. You can also add a "brightness" trait to a light device. This will allow you to control the brightness of the light.
